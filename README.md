# NHS Notify Supplier Config

This repository contains code and schemas for NHS Notify supplier configuration management and event publishing.

## Purpose

- **Configuration Model:** Defines and manages supplier, quota, routing, and related configuration for NHS Notify
  suppliers.
- **Event Schemas:** Publishes configuration changes as events to an event bus for consumption by other system
  components.

## Design

### Configuration Management

A phased approach will be used to improve supplier configuration management:

1. **Libraries & Validation:** Standardise configuration and naming, reduce manual errors, and improve auditability.
2. **API Layer:** Centralise access to supplier configuration data.
3. **Web UI:** Enable operations/admin teams to manage supplier configuration with validation and audit trails.

Configuration entities include:

- `supplier_quota`, `channel_supplier`, `queue`, `suppression_filter`, `govuknotify_account`

Configuration changes are validated, auditable, and published to environments via an event bus.

### Event Publishing

Configuration changes are published as events to a central event bus, enabling decoupled updates across bounded
contexts (core, print supplier API, template/routing UI, user management, etc.).

Event publishing strategies include:

- CLI tools (tactical)
- Admin/Web UI (strategic, single source of truth)

## Usage

### Testing

There are `make` tasks for you to configure to run your tests. Run
`make test` to see how they work. You should be able to use the same
entry points for local development as in your CI pipeline.
